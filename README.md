# jsCalculator

In this project there are 2 input fields, 4 buttons (add, subtract, multiply, divide), and an answer box

The idea is that the user will:
	- input two numbers
	- click on whicever operation they want to perform on the two numbers
	- get the answer displayed back to them in the answer box
